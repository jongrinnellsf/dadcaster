I recently attended the ETH San Francisco Hackathon as a volunteer and was fairly blown away with the magnitude of BUIDL.

I spoke with hackers, organizers, and other attendeesâ€Šâ€”â€Šlearning about their interests, their beliefs, and generally what draws people to ethereum. In fact, one common question I heard was: what brings you here? This inspired me to briefly articulate what excites me most about ethereum, and highlight a few specific projects from ETH San Francisco that fuel this interest.

Hereâ€™s 3 reasons why Iâ€™m excited:

ðŸ’¸ Open finance: Ethereum is enabling enabling individuals, regardless of where they live, a chance to participate in a new financial system. At ETH San Francisco, we saw open finance projects like primotif, which uses decentralized financial primitives to give anyone the opportunity to invest in global markets. We saw gifty://, which allows anyone to text an NFT (imagine sports/esports fans texting digital collectables). We also saw Good Mines, Change Lives, allowing individuals to finance tuition for those who otherwise could not afford it. In the long run, open finance will be a net good for the world and, at the very least, change how we think about ownership and access to financial services.
ðŸ”“ Identity & data: As with open finance, user controlled identity is another powerful use case of ethereum. Itâ€™s becoming clear that a handful of tech titans capitalize on our digital dataâ€” our browsing data, our likes, our friends, our purchasesâ€Šâ€”â€Šthese services are often convenient and free, but also invasive to the customer and bad for innovation. Ethereum, and broadly web3, is rethinking this model, one where your digital data is instead owned by you (imagine that). At ETH San Francisco, we saw several identity based projects. One was blockusign, which uses BloomID and IPFS to help with storage and ownership of documents. Another was CryptoSource, which attempts to both verify and protect the identity of whistleblowers. Also genomeCDP, which allows users to tokenize and potentially monetize their own DNA data. While identity is notoriously complex, ethereum based solutions are rapidly emerging.
ðŸš€ Momentum: With growing community engagement, multiple parallel scalability efforts, and both new and established players getting on board: the sheer momentum of ethereum is mesmerizing. For example, roughly 1,000 hackers attended ETH San Francisco. There were 121 submissions, up from 65 submissions at ETH Berlin, and 34 submissions at ETH Buenos Aires. DevCon IV is near ~3,000 attendees, up from 2,000 at DevCon III, and 800 at Devcon II. Given the momentum, I expect ethereum to continuously surprise and bring new products that empower individuals, particularly around open finance and identity use cases.
